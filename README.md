generocity | live generously
=============================


generocity is a chance to connect people interested in helping others with people in need. Born out of a group project in the final phase of Dev Bootcamp SF, our team spent a week conceptualizing, wireframing, researching eCommerce technologies and automated payment systems, designing a look and feel that promotes the ideas behind the project, and coding with the languages we've been immersed in for the last nine weeks. The result is a web application that lets users shop for pantry items and send them out to donation centers in San Francisco, CA.

generocity | live generously
=============================


generocity is a chance to connect people interested in helping others with people in need. Born out of a group project in the final phase of Dev Bootcamp SF, our team spent a week conceptualizing, wireframing, researching eCommerce technologies and automated payment systems, designing a look and feel that promotes the ideas behind the project, and coding with the languages we've been immersed in for the last nine weeks. The result is a web application that lets users shop for pantry items and send them to a donation center in San Francisco, CA.

## Technologies
We decided to build generocity with a framework we had all worked with before, while exploring new technologies to design and implement our supportive features.

* [Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) is the central framework taught at Dev Bootcamp. We built genrocity with it so we could expand our understanding of core features and learn ways to improve a few standard components, namely the testing suite.
* User authentication was built using [Devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise/versions/3.5.2), a Ruby gem.
* Our eCommerce shopping experience uses [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) on the front end, [Redis](http://redis.io/) as a shopping cart, and [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) to accept user payment. We started with a tutorial and customized it to fit our specific needs.
* Using [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/), we built an automated script to login to our Amazon account and purchase the items directly from their warehouse.
